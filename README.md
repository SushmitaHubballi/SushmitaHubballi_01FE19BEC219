This repository contains all the examples and assignments done during the course Advanced Digital Logic Design (ADLD). 

AND gate: It is a basic digital logic gate. A high output results only if all inputs are high else the output is low.

SR Flipflop: stands for "Set-Reset" flip flop. The reset input is used to get back the flip flop to its original state from the current state with an output 'Q'. This output depends on the set and reset conditions, which is either at the logic level "0" or "1".

Decoder: Decoder is a combinational logic circuit that converts coded input to coded outputs provided both of these are different from one another.
